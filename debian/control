Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libkf5i18n5 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}, python
Description: Advanced internationalization framework.
 Ki18n is the KDE internationalization system for
 user-interface text. It enables localization of
 user-visible strings, including locale-aware argument
 substitution and formatting. Ki18n is built atop the
 widely used Gettext internationalization system, making
 the workflow familiar to both programmers and translators.
 It can be considered a Gettext-wrapper for code based on
 the Qt library, but it also provides additional
 functionality over basic Gettext.
 .
 Contains development files for ki18n.
